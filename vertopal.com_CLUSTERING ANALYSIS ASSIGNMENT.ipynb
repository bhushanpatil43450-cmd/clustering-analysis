    "**CLUSTERING ANALYSIS ASSIGNMENT**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this assignment is to explore the concept of clustering, a\n",
    "type of unsupervised machine learning, through the implementation of\n",
    "three popular clustering techniques: **K-Means**, **Hierarchical\n",
    "Clustering**, and **DBSCAN**. These algorithms are applied to a\n",
    "real-world dataset to uncover hidden patterns, group similar\n",
    "observations, and draw insights from the structure of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Dataset and Preprocessing. Before** applying clustering algorithms,\n",
    "it is crucial to prepare the dataset properly. The following steps are\n",
    "taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.1 Handling Missing Values. Missing** data can skew the analysis and\n",
    "clustering results. Techniques like **mean/mode/median imputation** are\n",
    "used based on the type and distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2 Outlier Removal**\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers are detected using statistical methods such as **Z-score** or\n",
    "**IQR (Interquartile Range)**. Removing outliers helps in stabilizing\n",
    "clustering boundaries, especially for K-Means and DBSCAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.3 Feature Scaling**\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering algorithms are distance-based. Hence, feature scaling (e.g.,\n",
    "using **StandardScaler** or **MinMaxScaler**) is essential to bring all\n",
    "variables to the same scale, ensuring that no feature dominates others\n",
    "in distance calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA helps in understanding the structure of the data before clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.1 Summary Statistics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical summaries (mean, median, standard deviation) provide an\n",
    "overview of data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.2 Correlation Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation heatmaps help identify multicollinearity or dependencies\n",
    "among features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.3 Visualizations**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Histograms** show individual feature distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Pair plots** reveal feature relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Box plots** help detect outliers.\n",

    "**4. Clustering Algorithms**\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.1 K-Means Clustering**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   K-Means partitions the dataset into **K clusters** by minimizing the\n",
    "    variance within each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The optimal number of clusters (**K**) is determined using the\n",
    "    **Elbow Method**, where the inertia (within-cluster sum of squares)\n",
    "    is plotted against the number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Silhouette Score** is used to measure how similar an object is to\n",
    "    its own cluster versus other clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Fast and efficient on large datasets.\n",

    "**4.2 Hierarchical Clustering**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Builds a tree (dendrogram) showing the hierarchy of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Can be **agglomerative** (bottom-up) or **divisive** (top-down).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Distance between clusters can be measured using **linkage methods**:\n",
    "    single, complete, average, or Ward's.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dendrograms** help visualize and decide the number of clusters by\n",
    "identifying natural breaks.\n",

    "-   Groups points that are closely packed together and marks points in\n",
    "    low-density regions as outliers (noise).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Requires two parameters: **epsilon (eps)** – neighborhood radius,\n",
    "    and **minPts** – minimum number of points to form a dense region.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Can find arbitrarily shaped clusters.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "After clustering:\n",
    "\n",

    "-   Each cluster is colored differently to depict separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   For hierarchical clustering, **dendrograms** are plotted.\n",

    "-   Measures how close each point is to the points in its own cluster\n",
    "    compared to other clusters.\n",
